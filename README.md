# Yield in a semiconductor manufacturing

## Build classifier to predict the yield in a semiconductor manufacturing company
 
 <p align = "justify"> A semiconductor manufacturing company has sensor data comprising of <b>1567 datapoints</b> with <b>591 features</b>. Identification of the yield of manufacturing process using these many features is time consuming and may incur significant loss if gone wrong. The goal of the project was to determine key factors contributing to yield excursions downstream in the process and will enable an increase in process throughput, decreased time to learn and reduce per-unit production costs. The project was accomplished by employing supervised learning, ensemble modeling, and unsupervised learning techniques to build and train a prediction model to identify <b>Pass/Fail yield</b> of a particular process entity for a semiconductor manufacturing company. </p><br>
